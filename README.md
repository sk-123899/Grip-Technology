1] Task 1 :-
    (To Explore Supervised Machine Learning)
    In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to
    score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it
    involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data / in repository by name linear1.csv.
    What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?


2] Task 2 :-
    (To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning)
    From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

3] Task 3 :-
    (To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm )
    For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is
    if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

4] Task 4 :-
    (To explore Business Analytics)
    Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
    You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see how your company is performing. You are
    interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business
    problems you can derive by looking into the data?
